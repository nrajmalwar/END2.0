## [Session 3: Pytorch](Session_03)

Write a neural network that takes two inputs
* an image from MNIST dataset
* a random number between 0 and 9

and gives the output
* the "number" that was represented by the MNIST image
* the "sum" of this number with the random number that was generated and sent as the input to the network
